The idea is to learn something new every day about the world and get into the habit of writing regularly. As I write about a new country every day, I don’t have time to research things carefully. This means there may be many inaccuracies and outright errors. Please feel free to point them out to me if you encounter any. I primarily think of these notes as a public diary in which I keep track in (almost) real-time of the things I found interesting and the questions I had as I was learning about a new country.\r\nOverview\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay\r\nCountry\r\nContinent\r\nNotes\r\nDay 3\r\nBurundi\r\nAfrica\r\nSee notes for Burundi\r\nDay 2\r\nUganda\r\nAfrica\r\nSee notes for Uganda\r\nDay 1\r\nKenya\r\nAfrica\r\nSee notes for Kenya\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nBurundi\r\nCountries in the same region tend to have many things in common. One of the aspects in which Burundi is similar to some other countries in the region (Tanzania, in particular, comes to mind) is that it has recently changed its capital city. Historically, the capital of the pre-colonial Kingdom of Burundi was Gitega, which is now the second-largest city in Burundi. Around the time Burundi gained its independence from Belgium, Bujumbura became its capital city. Now it’s the country’s largest and economically most important city, conveniently located on the shore of Lake Tanganyika. A couple of years ago, Burundi’s then-president announced that the capital would be Gitega again.\r\nI’ve always wondered why countries change their capitals. I assume sometimes there is a purely political reason, such as moving to a politically more welcoming region. Other times, changing the capital can reflect, among other things, a genuine shift in the importance of certain regions within a country.\r\nFinally, let me mention two things briefly in which Burundi is a bit atypical in sub-Saharan Africa. First, Burundi is linguistically more homogeneous than most other countries in the region: almost everyone speaks Kirundi, while in other countries there is usually a large degree of linguistic diversity. Second, the current country’s territory occupies that of the pre-colonial Kingdom of Burundi. This is rare in that most current borders in the region don’t coincide with those of pre-colonial states.\r\nUganda\r\nUganda is named after Buganda, its largest region. Buganda is in the southern part of the country, and approximately 25% of the country’s 45 million residents live there—many of them in the capital, Kampala. People from Buganda are collectively called the Baganda (or Ganda), while a single person from this group is a Muganda. They speak a language called Luganda.\r\nIn yesterday’s post about Kenya, I mentioned that flags may contain useful information about a country. So, I duly checked Uganda’s flag. It depicts a grey crowned crane, Uganda’s national bird. So far so good. Today’s revelation (or reminder, rather) is that names can also contain interesting pieces of information.\r\nSuspecting that Buganda, Luganda, and Baganda may have something to do with the country’s name didn’t require a lot of effort because the words are almost identical. Without knowing too much about the country’s history, one would guess that the Baganda people must have played an important role in shaping Uganda’s past and present.\r\nDetecting that some words share a common root is not always as straightforward as in Uganda’s case. Had the words been a bit more different from one another, I could have easily overlooked the link between the country’s name and its most important region.\r\nKenya\r\nI’ve heard about the Maasai before, but I haven’t realized they are one of the largest ethnic groups in Kenya. It turns out that Kenya’s flag even features a Maasai shield. A note to my future self: checking out the symbols on a flag can give me some interesting leads. Another ethnic group I found interesting are the Kalenjin: many of the famous Kenyan middle- and long-distance runners are from this ethnic group. It would be interesting to know why.\r\nI also learned that the largest urban slum in Africa is a place called Kibera, on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. My questions: (1) Why there? In other words, is there a geographic, legal, or other reason why the slum is there, or is its location just the result of a random process?; (2) Did its residents move there from a particular region in Kenya (or East Africa)?\r\nNgũgĩ wa Thiong’o is one of the most popular Kenyan writers. He has a short story (The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright) that has been translated into 100 languages. Maybe it’s time for me to read some Kenyan literature.\r\nWhile I was reading about Kenya, I noticed many names and concepts that start with the letter K—for example, Kenya itself, or the aforementioned Kalenjin and Kibera. Is this a coincidence, or is the letter K indeed common in some or all the languages Kenyans use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

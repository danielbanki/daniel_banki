The idea is to learn something new every day about the world and get into the habit of writing regularly. As I write about a new country every day, I don’t have time to research things carefully. This means there may be many inaccuracies and outright errors. Please feel free to point them out to me if you encounter any. I primarily think of these notes as a public diary in which I keep track in (almost) real-time of the things I found interesting and the questions I had as I was learning about a new country.\r\nOverview\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDay\r\nCountry\r\nContinent\r\nNotes\r\nDay 1\r\nKenya\r\nAfrica\r\nSee notes for Kenya\r\n\r\nNotes\r\nKenya\r\nI’ve heard about the Maasai before, but I haven’t realized they are one of the largest ethnic groups in Kenya. It turns out that Kenya’s flag even features a Maasai shield. A note to my future self: checking out the symbols on a flag can give me some interesting leads. Another ethnic group I found interesting are the Kalenjin: many of the famous Kenyan middle- and long-distance runners are from this ethnic group. It would be interesting to know why.\r\nI also learned that the largest urban slum in Africa is a place called Kibera, on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. My questions: (1) Why there? In other words, is there a geographic, legal, or other reason why the slum is there, or is its location just the result of a random process?; (2) Did its residents move there from a particular region in Kenya (or East Africa)?\r\nNgũgĩ wa Thiong’o is one of the most popular Kenyan writers. He has a short story (The Upright Revolution: Or Why Humans Walk Upright) that has been translated into 100 languages. Maybe it’s time for me to read some Kenyan literature.\r\nWhile I was reading about Kenya, I noticed many names and concepts that start with the letter K—for example, Kenya itself, or the aforementioned Kalenjin and Kibera. Is this a coincidence, or is the letter K indeed common in some or all the languages Kenyans use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

## About

I'm a PhD student in Economics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain. Some academic topics close to my heart include judgment and decision making, the predictability of behavioural science, external validity, and second-order effects.

## Writing

My non-academic writing is on [Substack](https://joyofdiscovery.substack.com/). I write about human behaviour, using (typically) quite unconventional sources like manuals from intelligence agencies or old opinion polls.

## Social things

I run an in-person, non-fiction book club in Barcelona. More information about it here: [Barcelona Bibliophiles](https://sites.google.com/view/barcelona-bibliophiles/).

I organize [GEOGUESSR](https://www.geoguessr.com/) parties. Basically, we are staring at Google Street View for some time, trying to figure out where we are in the world. If you are also this type of weird, get in touch to join our group.

## Free mentoring

I was lucky to have people in my life who volunteered their time and effort to mentor me. I cannot pay them back, so I want to pay this forward. 

I offer free mentoring in the following areas: academic and PhD life, economics, psychology, social science research, cultivating a non-fiction reading habit, and everything related to Budapest, Hungary, and the Hungarian language and culture. 

I can do mentoring in English, Hungarian, and Spanish. I'm open to mentoring anybody, from any country, age group, etc. 

If you speak decent Hungarian as a non-native speaker and want to get better, I would be delighted to help you (for free, of course). 

## Work with me

I'm open to collaborations with organizations that are interested in running behavioral science experiments. So, if that's your case, let's talk.

## Contact

If you find what I do interesting, drop me a line. I'm always open to meeting new peopleâ€”both online and in person. I'm based in Barcelona and am happy to go for a coffee or a walk with anybody who reaches out.
